A lightweight and easy to use ARM/THUMB disassembler library written in C.
From the author of diStorm.

This version is really working and useable. Compile all files and see main.c for a small test reference, for now.

At this point only the Thumb instruction set part of the disassembler is ready but not really tested. It's pure source now, later on I will add makefile and change directories hierarchy and so on.
Everything is subject to change, as I'm starting to work on the ARM instruction set, I will change lots of code and interfaces as I see fit.
